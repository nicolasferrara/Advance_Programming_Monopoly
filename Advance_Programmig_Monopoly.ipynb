    "# Game states tracker and players information :\n",
    "I start by creating the lists and variables that will track the game's state and players' information. First, I create a list named ‘current_position’ to track each player's position on the board, with all players starting at zero. Following this, a variable called ‘player’ is introduced to identify which of the four players is currently taking their turn, starting with player 0 (from player 0 to player 3). Additionally, I create a list named ‘colour’ which designates a specific colour to each player according to their turn order: player 0 is pink, player 1 is lime, player 2 is silver, and player 3 is beige. Next, I create a list called ‘bank’, that will store the bank accounts of each player, with each player beginning with a bank balance of $1500. Finally, a dataframe named ‘result’ is created with columns corresponding to each player's colour. This dataframe is intended to keep a record of each player's bank account status at the end of each turn."
